# Things I would work on if given more time

- Typesafety between Nest and Next: use Zod + generated types (assuming nestjs has a way to generate types based on the controllers)
- Component composition: Split the form and the list into different files with a parent the controls state
- Styling: Make the whole thing look better
- Validate inputs before form submission and DB insert
- Loading/Error/Success states: Use toast for success messages and some error messages, inline validation errors on inputs

# Interview Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Fluint.io hands-on coding assignment. The goal of this assignment is NOT to create a production-level service but to allow us to see how you naturally go about implementing solutions to problems.

## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be installed on your development machine:

- Docker Desktop
- docker-compose

## Submission Steps:

1. Fork or degit (link https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) this repository.
2. Evaluate the README.md and solve the issues laid out in the scenario.
3. Send any questions for clarification to jon@fluint.io.
4. Submit your application by emailing a link to your solution and resume to jon@fluint.io.

## The Scenario

Build a simple form that allows users to create, edit, and delete data.

This will involve:

### Frontend (fe/):

Create UI with forms to add/edit data.
Display list of data.
Ability to delete data.

### Backend (be/):

APIs to create, read, update, and delete data.
Store data in a MongoDB database.
Database (mongodb/):

Collect data with fields like id, and content.

## The Environment

This is a monorepo for an application with a Next.js frontend and a Nest.js backend. All of the core scaffolding is in place that is needed to have these projects running locally. Everything is encapsulated in a docker-compose environment (including CLI containers), so the only dependencies needed to run the application are Docker Desktop and docker-compose.

The Mongoose configuration is in place for communication between the BE Nest.js project and the FE project.

## Important Commands

### Install dependencies

For the FE project:

Copy code

docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm fe-cli npm install
For the BE project:

Copy code

docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm be-cli npm install
Start the application
Copy code

docker-compose up
Note: This will start up the application and make the frontend of the application available from a browser at http://localhost:8080/, and the backend API is available at http://localhost:3000/. Changes on the backend will be hot deployed to the container.

### Stop the application

Copy code

docker-compose down

### Install a new library

For the FE project:

Copy code

docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm fe-cli npm i <package>
For the BE project:

Copy code

docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm be-cli npm i <package>

### Bash for a project

For the FE project:

Copy code

docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm fe-cli bash
For the BE project:

Copy code

docker-compose -f docker-compose.cli.yml run --rm be-cli bash

## NOTES

- IMPORTANT: CORS is not enabled so make sure to use mode: 'no-cors' on all api calls to the BE
- Commands from the compose file docker-compose.cli.yml run in a container but are mounted to your local file system.
